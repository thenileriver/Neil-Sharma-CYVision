# Neil-Sharma-CYVision

The only files for the heatmap model I am allowed to share are the files I contributed to and that I have been given permission to share. For example, I contributed lines of code to the neural network architecture but I'm not allowed to show my contributions. There are other files in the model that I never contributed to and as a result will not be shown. 

Thank you for understanding.
